# postgres-test
A sample set of data, and some simple questions on postgres designed to test various joins, functions, and techniques

# Instructions

1. Create a postgres database 
2. Run the db-init.sql (Created in PostgreSQL 9.4) file pointed at your newly created database. This will create a very light schema and populate it with data - Please note that this needs to be run from the command line and will not function properly being run directly with tools such as PGAdmin3 (Ex: psql -h localhost -d myDb -U MyUser -f db-init.sql)
3. Answer the questions contained in the questions.txt file
